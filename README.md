# memory-cards
Share and discuss memories and stories about your favorite video games

Memory Cards is an independent project inspired by my love of video games. Many of my happiest memories growing up involved playing video games alone or with my friends. I made Memory Cards to celebrate retro games and to provide a forum for people to share special memories.

I built Memory Cards using React and Firebase. As a front end developer, I found the combination of React and Firebase to be a great way to build powerful applications. So far Memory Cards is a fairly simple application, but I plan to build it to be more robust.

Login and register is managed by Firebase authentication. Memory Cards users can create an account and login using their Google Account. I plan to add other methods of sign in in the future.
